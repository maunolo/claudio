This tool allows you to send and receive audio over a network using the VBAN protocol.
VBAN is a protocol for sending audio over a network.

This tool is a work in progress. It is not yet feature complete and may not work as expected.
Please report any issues you encounter on the GitHub page.

Only supports 48kHz, PCM 16-bits, 2-channels audio for now. This will be expanded in the future.

This tool is not affiliated with VBAN.
